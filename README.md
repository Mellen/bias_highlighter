# Bias Highlighter

It's a chrome extension that follows what you type and highlights, with a tooltip, when you use a word you want to stop using.

For example some people want to stop using words like "guys", "lame", "spastic", as they are derogatory in a "punching down" way, so if these words are added to the list, then a tool tip will pop up when ever they're typed into a text box (or similar control).
